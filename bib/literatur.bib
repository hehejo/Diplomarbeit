  abstract = {The success of the P2P idea has created a huge diversity of approaches,
	among which overlay networks, for example, Gnutella, Kazaa, Chord,
	Pastry, Tapestry, P-Grid, or DKS, have received specific attention
	from both developers and researchers. A wide variety of algorithms,
	data structures, and architectures have been proposed. The terminologies
	and abstractions used, however, have become quite inconsistent since
	the P2P paradigm has attracted people from many different communities,
	e.g., networking, databases, distributed systems, graph theory, complexity
	theory, biology, etc. In this paper we propose a reference model
	for overlay networks which is capable of modeling different approaches
	in this domain in a generic manner. It is intended to allow researchers
	and users to assess the properties of concrete systems, to establish
	a common vocabulary for scientific discussion, to facilitate the
	qualitative comparison of the systems, and to serve as the basis
	for defining a standardized API to make overlay networks interoperable.},

  year = {2005},
  pages = {1--10},

  abstract = {In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors
	to exchange movement information among players, there is inaccuracy
	in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between
	the sender and the receiver. The object is placed at the receiver
	at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that
	time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender.
	This inaccuracy would be tolerable if it is consistent among all
	players; that is, at the same physical time, all players see inaccurate
	(with respect to the real position of the object) but the same position
	and trajectory for an object. But due to varying network delays between
	the sender and different receivers, the inaccuracy is different at
	different players as well. This leads to unfairness in game playing.
	In this paper, we first introduce an "error" measure for estimating
	this inaccuracy. Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the
	sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make
	this error equal at different receivers over time. This algorithm
	makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall
	mean error of all players. To mitigate this effect, we propose a
	budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing
	the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.
	We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget
	based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player
	game. We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness
	among players in spite of widely varying network delays. An additional
	property of the proposed algorithms is that they require less number
	of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of
	BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.},

	changes in distributed computing. New environments such as massively
	large-scale, wide-area computer networks and mobile ad hoc networks
	have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments include
	extreme dynamicity, unreliability, and large scale. Traditional approaches
	to designing distributed applications in these environments based

	are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on
	the observation that living organisms can effectively organize large

	molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures,
	it has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas
	and mechanisms that make biological systems work and to apply them
	to distributed systems engineering. In this article we propose a
	conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes
	in the form of a family of design patterns. Examples include plain
	diffusion, replication, chemotaxis, and stigmergy. We show through
	examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing
	based on these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we
	show that our bio-inspired solutions have performance comparable

	of new protocols. This paper presents OverSim, a flexible overlay
	network simulation framework based on OMNeT++. It was designed to
	fulfill a number of requirements that have been partially neglected
	by existing simulation frameworks. OverSim includes several structured
	and unstructured peer-to-peer protocols like Chord, Kademlia and
	Gia. These protocol implementations can be used for both simulation
	as well as real world networks. To facilitate the implementation
	of additional protocols and to make them more comparable OverSim
	provides several common functions like a generic lookup mechanism
	for structured peer-to-peer networks and an RPC interface. Several
	exchangeable underlay network models allow to simulate complex heterogeneous
	underlay networks as well as simplified networks for large-scale
	simulations. We show that with OverSim simulations of overlay networks
	with up to 100,000 nodes are feasible.},

	achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it
	reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention
	to, thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important
	state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity
	by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the
	special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are
	latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We
	present user study results using a prototype implementation based
	on Quake III that show our approach provides a desirable user experience.

	deployment problems of IP level multicast by establishing delivery
	trees using overlay links among end systems. This paper presents
	algorithms to support traffic engineering, to improve the reliability

	First, we introduce the so-called backup multicast tree algorithm
	to compute a set of n - 1 backup multicast delivery trees from the
	default multicast tree. Each backup multicast tree has exactly one
	link of the default multicast tree that is replaced by a backup link
	from the set of available links. The algorithm can calculate this
	set of trees with a complexity of O (m log n), which is identical
	with the complexity of well known minimum spanning tree algorithms.
	The so-called reduced multicast tree algorithm is based on the backup
	multicast tree algorithm and can calculate a tree from the default
	multicast tree by removing a particular node and by replacing the
	links of the removed node. Using the algorithms trees can be calculated
	individually by each of the nodes but it requires global topology
	knowledge. We therefore discuss distributed versions of the algorithms.},

	importantly, the challenging task of routing messages based on their

	provides results that are just barely better than a simple broadcast.
	In this paper, we present a novel approach to publish/subscribe that
	was designed to specifically address these issues. The producers
	and consumers are organized in a peer-to-peer network that self-adapts
	upon peer arrival, departure, or failure. Our publish/subscribe system
	features an extremely simple and efficient routing process and excellent
	scalability to large consumer populations, both in terms of routing
	and peer management overhead.},

  month = {April},
  abstract = {In content networks, messages are routed on the basis of their content
	and the interests (subscriptions) of the message consumers. This
	form of routing offers an interesting alternative to unicast or multicast
	communication in loosely-coupled distributed systems with large number
	of consumers, with diverse interests, wide geographical dispersion,
	and heterogeneous resources (e.g., CPU, bandwidth). In this paper,
	we propose a novel protocol for content-based routing in overlay
	networks. This protocol guarantees perfect routing (i.e., a message
	is received by all, and only those, consumers that have registered
	a matching subscription) and optimizes the usage of the network bandwidth.
	Furthermore, our protocol takes advantage of subscription aggregation
	to dramatically reduce the size of the routing tables, and it fully
	supports dynamic subscription registrations and cancellations without
	impacting the routing accuracy. We have implemented this protocol
	in the application-level routers of an overlay network to build a
	scalable XML-based data dissemination system. Experimental evaluation
	shows that the size of the routing tables remains small, even with
	very large populations of consumers.},

	such as parameterization and aggregation, which significantly extend
	the expressive power of standard pub/sub systems. Based on a set
	of formally defined language operators, the subscription language
	of Cayuga provides non-ambiguous subscription semantics as well as
	unique opportunities for optimizations. We experimentally demonstrate
	that common optimization techniques used in NFA-based systems such
	as state merging have only limited effectiveness, and we propose
	novel efficient indexing methods to speed up subscription processing.
	In a thorough experimental evaluation we show the efficacy of our

  abstract = {Overlay networks among cooperating hosts have recently emerged as
	a viable solution to several challenging problems, including multicasting,
	routing, content distribution, and peer-to-peer services. Application-level
	overlays, however, incur a performance penalty over router-level
	solutions. This paper quantifies and explains this performance penalty
	for overlay multicast trees via: 1) Internet experimental data; 2)
	simulations; and 3) theoretical models. We compare a number of overlay
	multicast protocols with respect to overlay tree structure, and underlying
	network characteristics. Experimental data and simulations illustrate
	that the mean number of hops and mean per-hop delay between parent
	and child hosts in overlay trees generally decrease as the level
	of the host in the overlay tree increases. Overlay multicast routing
	strategies, overlay host distribution, and Internet topology characteristics
	are identified as three primary causes of the observed phenomenon.
	We show that this phenomenon yields overlay tree cost savings: Our
	results reveal that the normalized cost L(n)/U(n) is propn 0.9 for
	small n, where L(n) is the total number of hops in all overlay links,
	U(n) is the average number of hops on the source to receiver unicast
	paths, and n is the number of members in the overlay multicast session.
	This can be compared to an IP multicast cost proportional to n 0.6

	attracted the attention on the so called wireless mesh community

	the efficient retrieval of the information on resource location based
	on the Viceroy peer-to-peer algorithm. Differently from Viceroy,
	Georoy exploits the capability of setting and managing a direct mapping
	between the resource ID and the node which maintains information

	multicast, N-Trees organize peers by their application-level scope
	of interest, instead of by their delay-based shortest-path tree.
	This organization allows peers which are close by in the virtual
	world to order events without needing to communicate with other peers
	that are farther away. We show the asymptotic analysis of N-Trees
	indicates that they will perform well for scalable peer-to-peer event
	ordering. We also provide an analysis of N-Trees in comparison to

	subset of a set of available nodes to use.First, we provide a comparison
	of the performance of a range of different node selection strategies
	in five real-world traces. Among our findings is that the simple
	strategy of picking a uniform-random replacement whenever a node
	fails performs surprisingly well. We explain its performance through
	analysis in a stochastic model.Second, we show that a class of strategies,
	which we call "Preference List" strategies, arise commonly as a result
	of optimizing for a metric other than churn, and produce high churn
	relative to more randomized strategies under realistic node failure
	patterns. Using this insight, we demonstrate and explain differences
	in performance for designs that incorporate varying degrees of randomization.
	We give examples from a variety of protocols, including anycast,
	over-lay multicast, and distributed hash tables. In many cases, simply
	adding some randomization can go a long way towards reducing churn.},

	that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances — was inaugurated
	as an area of experimental study in the social sciences through the
	pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960's. This work was among
	the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to
	speak of the ” six degrees of separation ” between any two people
	in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have
	been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem analytically.
	One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent
	work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence
	that the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks
	arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in
	the evolution of the World Wide Web. But existing models are insufficient
	to explain the striking algorithmic component of Milgram's original
	findings: that individuals using local information are collectively
	very effective at actually constructing short paths between two points
	in a social network. Although recently proposed network models are
	rich in short paths, we prove that no decentralized algorithm, operating
	with local information only, can construct short paths in these networks
	with non-negligible probability. We then define an infinite family
	of network models that naturally generalizes the Watts-Strogatz model,
	and show that for one of these models, there is a decentralized algorithm
	capable of finding short paths with high probability. More generally,
	we provide a strong characterization of this family of network models,
	showing that there is in fact a unique model within the family for
	which decentralized algorithms are effective.},

	need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here, applications arrange
	themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within
	the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that
	uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An
	advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each
	application to locally derive next-hop routing information without
	requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using
	a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the
	network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal.
	We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol),
	which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present
	measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with
	up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with
	100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly,
	e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over
	30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead
	of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network
	is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast
	transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in
	the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately
	15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with
	1000 nodes.},

  abstract = {Designing an overlay network for publish/subscribe communication in
	a system where nodes may subscribe to many different topics of interest
	is of fundamental importance. For scalability and efficiency, it
	is important to keep the degree of the nodes in the publish/subscribe
	system low. It is only natural then to formalize the following problem:
	Given a collection of nodes and their topic subscriptions connect
	the nodes into a graph which has least possible maximum degree and
	in such a way that for each topic t, the graph induced by the nodes
	interested in t is connected. We present the first polynomial time
	logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem and prove an
	almost tight lower bound on the approximation ratio. Our experimental
	results show that our algorithm drastically improves the maximum
	degree of publish/subscribe overlay systems. We also propose a variation
	of the problem by enforcing that each topic-connected overlay network
	be of constant diameter, while keeping the average degree low. We
	present a heuristic for this problem which guarantees that each topic-connected
	overlay network will be of diameter 2 and which aims at keeping the
	overall average node degree low. Our experimental results validate
	our algorithm showing that our algorithm is able to achieve very
	low diameter without increasing the average degree by much.},

	where each receiver (or participating peer) (i) independently discovers
	other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and (ii) selfishly
	determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect
	to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth. Participating
	peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to
	high churn rate. than structured overlay networks. Furthermore, each
	receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents
	as implicit signal to detect and react to long-term changes in network
	or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other
	participating peers. Independent parent selection by individual peers
	dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure.},

	Scalability in this context has usually been expressed in terms of
	message throughput and delivery latency, but there has been little
	work on how to reduce the memory consumption for membership management
	and message buffering at large scale.This paper presents lightweight
	probabilistic broadcast ( lpbcast ), a novel gossip-based broadcast
	algorithm, which complements the inherent throughput scalability
	of traditional probabilistic broadcast algorithms with a scalable
	memory management technique. Our algorithm is completely decentralized
	and based only on local information: in particular, every process
	only knows a fixed subset of processes in the system and only buffers
	fixed "most suitable" subsets of messages. We analyze our broadcast
	algorithm stochastically and compare the analytical results both
	with simulations and concrete implementation measurements.},

  abstract = {We study a fundamental tradeoff issue in designing a distributed hash
	table (DHT) in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks: the size of the routing
	table versus the network diameter. Observing that existing DHT schemes
	have either 1) a routing table size and network diameter both of
	O(log 2 n), or 2) a routing table of size d and network diameter
	of O(n 1 d/), S. Ratnasamy et al. (2001) asked whether this represents
	the best asymptotic "state-efficiency" tradeoffs. We show that some
	straightforward routing algorithms achieve better asymptotic tradeoffs.
	However, such algorithms all cause severe congestion on certain network
	nodes, which is undesirable in a P2P network. We rigorously define
	the notion of "congestion" and conjecture that the above tradeoffs
	are asymptotically optimal for a congestion-free network. The answer
	to this conjecture is negative in the strict sense. However, it becomes
	positive if the routing algorithm is required to eliminate congestion
	in a "natural" way by being uniform. We also prove that the tradeoffs
	are asymptotically optimal for uniform algorithms. Furthermore, for
	uniform algorithms, we find that the routing table size of O(log
	2 n) is a magic threshold point that separates two different "state-efficiency"
	regions. Our third result is to study the exact (instead of asymptotic)
	optimal tradeoffs for uniform algorithms. We propose a new routing
	algorithm that reduces the routing table size and the network diameter
	of Chord both by 21.4\% without introducing any other protocol overhead,
	based on a novel number-theory technique. Our final result is to
	present Ulysses, a congestion-free nonuniform algorithm that achieves
	a better asymptotic "state-efficiency" tradeoff than existing schemes
	in the probabilistic sense, even under dynamic node joins/leaves.},

	offering efficient, scalable, location-independent routing of messages
	directly to nearby copies of an object or service using only localized
	resources. Tapestry supports a generic decentralized object location
	and routing applications programming interface using a self-repairing,
	soft-state-based routing layer. The paper presents the Tapestry architecture,
	algorithms, and implementation. It explores the behavior of a Tapestry
	deployment on PlanetLab, a global testbed of approximately 100 machines.
	Experimental results show that Tapestry exhibits stable behavior
	and performance as an overlay, despite the instability of the underlying
	network layers. Several widely distributed applications have been
	implemented on Tapestry, illustrating its utility as a deployment
	infrastructure.},

  abstract = {In today''s chaotic network, data and services are mobile and replicated
	widely for availability, durability, and locality. Components within
	this infrastructure interact in rich and complex ways, greatly stressing
	traditional approaches to name service and routing. This paper explores
	an alternative to traditional approaches called Tapestry. Tapestry
	is an overlay location and routing infrastructure that provides location-independent
	routing of messages directly to the closest copy of an object or
	service using only point-to-point links and without centralized resources.
	The routing and directory information within this infrastructure
	is purely soft state and easily repaired. Tapestry is self-administering,
	fault-tolerant, and resilient under load. This paper presents the
	architecture and algorithms of Tapestry and explores their advantages
	through a number of experiments.},
