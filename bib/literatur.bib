  abstract = {The success of the P2P idea has created a huge diversity of approaches,
	among which overlay networks, for example, Gnutella, Kazaa, Chord,
	Pastry, Tapestry, P-Grid, or DKS, have received specific attention
	from both developers and researchers. A wide variety of algorithms,
	data structures, and architectures have been proposed. The terminologies
	and abstractions used, however, have become quite inconsistent since
	the P2P paradigm has attracted people from many different communities,
	e.g., networking, databases, distributed systems, graph theory, complexity
	theory, biology, etc. In this paper we propose a reference model
	for overlay networks which is capable of modeling different approaches
	in this domain in a generic manner. It is intended to allow researchers
	and users to assess the properties of concrete systems, to establish
	a common vocabulary for scientific discussion, to facilitate the
	qualitative comparison of the systems, and to serve as the basis
	for defining a standardized API to make overlay networks interoperable.},

  abstract = {In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors
	to exchange movement information among players, there is inaccuracy
	in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between
	the sender and the receiver. The object is placed at the receiver
	at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that
	time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender.
	This inaccuracy would be tolerable if it is consistent among all
	players; that is, at the same physical time, all players see inaccurate
	(with respect to the real position of the object) but the same position
	and trajectory for an object. But due to varying network delays between
	the sender and different receivers, the inaccuracy is different at
	different players as well. This leads to unfairness in game playing.
	In this paper, we first introduce an "error" measure for estimating
	this inaccuracy. Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the
	sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make
	this error equal at different receivers over time. This algorithm
	makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall
	mean error of all players. To mitigate this effect, we propose a
	budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing
	the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.
	We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget
	based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player
	game. We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness
	among players in spite of widely varying network delays. An additional
	property of the proposed algorithms is that they require less number
	of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of
	BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.},

  abstract = {Application Level Multicast is a promising approach to overcome the
	deployment problems of IP level multicast by establishing delivery
	trees using overlay links among end systems. This paper presents
	algorithms to support traffic engineering, to improve the reliability
	of multicast delivery, and to facilitate secure group communications.
	First, we introduce the so-called backup multicast tree algorithm
	to compute a set of n - 1 backup multicast delivery trees from the
	default multicast tree. Each backup multicast tree has exactly one
	link of the default multicast tree that is replaced by a backup link
	from the set of available links. The algorithm can calculate this
	set of trees with a complexity of O (m log n), which is identical
	with the complexity of well known minimum spanning tree algorithms.
	The so-called reduced multicast tree algorithm is based on the backup
	multicast tree algorithm and can calculate a tree from the default
	multicast tree by removing a particular node and by replacing the
	links of the removed node. Using the algorithms trees can be calculated
	individually by each of the nodes but it requires global topology
	knowledge. We therefore discuss distributed versions of the algorithms.},

	is received by all, and only those, consumers that have registered
	a matching subscription) and optimizes the usage of the network bandwidth.
	Furthermore, our protocol takes advantage of subscription aggregation
	to dramatically reduce the size of the routing tables, and it fully
	supports dynamic subscription registrations and cancellations without
	impacting the routing accuracy. We have implemented this protocol
	in the application-level routers of an overlay network to build a

	a viable solution to several challenging problems, including multicasting,
	routing, content distribution, and peer-to-peer services. Application-level
	overlays, however, incur a performance penalty over router-level
	solutions. This paper quantifies and explains this performance penalty
	for overlay multicast trees via: 1) Internet experimental data; 2)
	simulations; and 3) theoretical models. We compare a number of overlay
	multicast protocols with respect to overlay tree structure, and underlying
	network characteristics. Experimental data and simulations illustrate
	that the mean number of hops and mean per-hop delay between parent
	and child hosts in overlay trees generally decrease as the level
	of the host in the overlay tree increases. Overlay multicast routing
	strategies, overlay host distribution, and Internet topology characteristics
	are identified as three primary causes of the observed phenomenon.
	We show that this phenomenon yields overlay tree cost savings: Our
	results reveal that the normalized cost L(n)/U(n) is propn 0.9 for
	small n, where L(n) is the total number of hops in all overlay links,
	U(n) is the average number of hops on the source to receiver unicast
	paths, and n is the number of members in the overlay multicast session.
	This can be compared to an IP multicast cost proportional to n 0.6
	to n 0.8},

	requires all-to-all message passing with at least two rounds of communication
	\cite{keidar01}. Multiplayer games add real-time constraints to this
	scenario. To meet this challenge, we develop an event scoping mechanism
	that uses N-Trees for event propagation. Unlike traditional application-layer
	multicast, N-Trees organize peers by their application-level scope
	of interest, instead of by their delay-based shortest-path tree.
	This organization allows peers which are close by in the virtual
	world to order events without needing to communicate with other peers
	that are farther away. We show the asymptotic analysis of N-Trees
	indicates that they will perform well for scalable peer-to-peer event
	ordering. We also provide an analysis of N-Trees in comparison to
	other distributed architectures for peer-to-peer games.},

	need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here, applications arrange
	themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within
	the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that
	uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An
	advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each
	application to locally derive next-hop routing information without
	requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using
	a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the
	network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal.
	We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol),
	which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present
	measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with
	up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with
	100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly,
	e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over
	30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead
	of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network
	is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast
	transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in
	the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately
	15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with
	1000 nodes.},

	the activities of thousands of entities interacting in a virtual

	used protocols that dictated that all entities broadcast messages
	about all activities, including remaining immobile or inactive, to
	all other entities, resulting in an explosion of incoming messages
	for all entities, most of which were of no interest. Using a filtering
	mechanism called interest management, some of these systems now allow
	entities to express interest in only the subset of information that
	is relevant to them. This paper surveys ten such systems, describing
	the purpose of the system, its scope, and the salient characteristics
	of its interest management scheme. We present the first taxonomy
	for such systems and classify the ten systems according to the taxonomy.
	The analysis of the classification reveals the fundamental nature

  month = {April},
  abstract = {Designing an overlay network for publish/subscribe communication in
	a system where nodes may subscribe to many different topics of interest
	is of fundamental importance. For scalability and efficiency, it
	is important to keep the degree of the nodes in the publish/subscribe
	system low. It is only natural then to formalize the following problem:
	Given a collection of nodes and their topic subscriptions connect
	the nodes into a graph which has least possible maximum degree and
	in such a way that for each topic t, the graph induced by the nodes
	interested in t is connected. We present the first polynomial time
	logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem and prove an
	almost tight lower bound on the approximation ratio. Our experimental
	results show that our algorithm drastically improves the maximum
	degree of publish/subscribe overlay systems. We also propose a variation
	of the problem by enforcing that each topic-connected overlay network
	be of constant diameter, while keeping the average degree low. We
	present a heuristic for this problem which guarantees that each topic-connected
	overlay network will be of diameter 2 and which aims at keeping the
	overall average node degree low. Our experimental results validate
	our algorithm showing that our algorithm is able to achieve very
	low diameter without increasing the average degree by much.},

  abstract = {Gossip-based broadcast algorithms, a family of probabilistic broadcast
	algorithms, trade reliability guarantees against "scalability" properties.
	Scalability in this context has usually been expressed in terms of
	message throughput and delivery latency, but there has been little
	work on how to reduce the memory consumption for membership management
	and message buffering at large scale.This paper presents lightweight
	probabilistic broadcast ( lpbcast ), a novel gossip-based broadcast
	algorithm, which complements the inherent throughput scalability
	of traditional probabilistic broadcast algorithms with a scalable
	memory management technique. Our algorithm is completely decentralized
	and based only on local information: in particular, every process
	only knows a fixed subset of processes in the system and only buffers
	fixed "most suitable" subsets of messages. We analyze our broadcast
	algorithm stochastically and compare the analytical results both
	with simulations and concrete implementation measurements.},

	out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling

	We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities
	and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many
