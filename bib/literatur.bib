  abstract = {The success of the P2P idea has created a huge diversity of approaches,
	among which overlay networks, for example, Gnutella, Kazaa, Chord,
	Pastry, Tapestry, P-Grid, or DKS, have received specific attention
	from both developers and researchers. A wide variety of algorithms,
	data structures, and architectures have been proposed. The terminologies
	and abstractions used, however, have become quite inconsistent since
	the P2P paradigm has attracted people from many different communities,
	e.g., networking, databases, distributed systems, graph theory, complexity
	theory, biology, etc. In this paper we propose a reference model
	for overlay networks which is capable of modeling different approaches
	in this domain in a generic manner. It is intended to allow researchers
	and users to assess the properties of concrete systems, to establish
	a common vocabulary for scientific discussion, to facilitate the
	qualitative comparison of the systems, and to serve as the basis
	for defining a standardized API to make overlay networks interoperable.},

  year = {2005},
  pages = {1--10},

  publisher = {ACM},
  abstract = {In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors
	to exchange movement information among players, there is inaccuracy
	in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between
	the sender and the receiver. The object is placed at the receiver
	at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that
	time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender.
	This inaccuracy would be tolerable if it is consistent among all
	players; that is, at the same physical time, all players see inaccurate
	(with respect to the real position of the object) but the same position
	and trajectory for an object. But due to varying network delays between
	the sender and different receivers, the inaccuracy is different at
	different players as well. This leads to unfairness in game playing.
	In this paper, we first introduce an "error" measure for estimating
	this inaccuracy. Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the
	sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make
	this error equal at different receivers over time. This algorithm
	makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall
	mean error of all players. To mitigate this effect, we propose a
	budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing
	the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.
	We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget
	based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player
	game. We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness
	among players in spite of widely varying network delays. An additional
	property of the proposed algorithms is that they require less number
	of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of
	BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.},

	changes in distributed computing. New environments such as massively
	large-scale, wide-area computer networks and mobile ad hoc networks
	have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments include
	extreme dynamicity, unreliability, and large scale. Traditional approaches
	to designing distributed applications in these environments based
	on central control, small scale, or strong reliability assumptions
	are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on
	the observation that living organisms can effectively organize large
	numbers of unreliable and dynamically-changing components (cells,
	molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures,
	it has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas
	and mechanisms that make biological systems work and to apply them
	to distributed systems engineering. In this article we propose a
	conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes
	in the form of a family of design patterns. Examples include plain
	diffusion, replication, chemotaxis, and stigmergy. We show through
	examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing
	based on these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we
	show that our bio-inspired solutions have performance comparable
	to traditional, state-of-the-art solutions while they inherit desirable
	properties of biological systems including adaptivity and robustness.},

	fulfill a number of requirements that have been partially neglected
	by existing simulation frameworks. OverSim includes several structured
	and unstructured peer-to-peer protocols like Chord, Kademlia and
	Gia. These protocol implementations can be used for both simulation
	as well as real world networks. To facilitate the implementation
	of additional protocols and to make them more comparable OverSim
	provides several common functions like a generic lookup mechanism
	for structured peer-to-peer networks and an RPC interface. Several
	exchangeable underlay network models allow to simulate complex heterogeneous
	underlay networks as well as simplified networks for large-scale
	simulations. We show that with OverSim simulations of overlay networks
	with up to 100,000 nodes are feasible.},

	achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it
	reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention
	to, thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important
	state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity
	by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the
	special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are
	latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We

	deployment problems of IP level multicast by establishing delivery

	algorithms to support traffic engineering, to improve the reliability

	First, we introduce the so-called backup multicast tree algorithm
	to compute a set of n - 1 backup multicast delivery trees from the
	default multicast tree. Each backup multicast tree has exactly one
	link of the default multicast tree that is replaced by a backup link
	from the set of available links. The algorithm can calculate this
	set of trees with a complexity of O (m log n), which is identical
	with the complexity of well known minimum spanning tree algorithms.
	The so-called reduced multicast tree algorithm is based on the backup
	multicast tree algorithm and can calculate a tree from the default
	multicast tree by removing a particular node and by replacing the
	links of the removed node. Using the algorithms trees can be calculated
	individually by each of the nodes but it requires global topology
	knowledge. We therefore discuss distributed versions of the algorithms.},

	and the interests (subscriptions) of the message consumers. This
	form of routing offers an interesting alternative to unicast or multicast
	communication in loosely-coupled distributed systems with large number
	of consumers, with diverse interests, wide geographical dispersion,
	and heterogeneous resources (e.g., CPU, bandwidth). In this paper,
	we propose a novel protocol for content-based routing in overlay
	networks. This protocol guarantees perfect routing (i.e., a message
	is received by all, and only those, consumers that have registered
	a matching subscription) and optimizes the usage of the network bandwidth.
	Furthermore, our protocol takes advantage of subscription aggregation
	to dramatically reduce the size of the routing tables, and it fully
	supports dynamic subscription registrations and cancellations without
	impacting the routing accuracy. We have implemented this protocol
	in the application-level routers of an overlay network to build a
	scalable XML-based data dissemination system. Experimental evaluation
	shows that the size of the routing tables remains small, even with
	very large populations of consumers.},

	users to express stateless subscriptions evaluated on individual
	events. However, many applications such as monitoring RSS streams,
	stock tickers, or management of RFID data streams require the ability
	to handle stateful subscriptions. In this paper, we introduce Cayuga,
	a stateful pub/sub system based on nondeterministic finite state
	automata (NFA). Cayuga allows users to express subscriptions that
	span multiple events, and it supports powerful language features
	such as parameterization and aggregation, which significantly extend
	the expressive power of standard pub/sub systems. Based on a set
	of formally defined language operators, the subscription language
	of Cayuga provides non-ambiguous subscription semantics as well as
	unique opportunities for optimizations. We experimentally demonstrate
	that common optimization techniques used in NFA-based systems such
	as state merging have only limited effectiveness, and we propose
	novel efficient indexing methods to speed up subscription processing.
	In a thorough experimental evaluation we show the efficacy of our
	approach.},

  abstract = {Overlay networks among cooperating hosts have recently emerged as
	a viable solution to several challenging problems, including multicasting,
	routing, content distribution, and peer-to-peer services. Application-level
	overlays, however, incur a performance penalty over router-level
	solutions. This paper quantifies and explains this performance penalty
	for overlay multicast trees via: 1) Internet experimental data; 2)
	simulations; and 3) theoretical models. We compare a number of overlay
	multicast protocols with respect to overlay tree structure, and underlying
	network characteristics. Experimental data and simulations illustrate
	that the mean number of hops and mean per-hop delay between parent
	and child hosts in overlay trees generally decrease as the level
	of the host in the overlay tree increases. Overlay multicast routing
	strategies, overlay host distribution, and Internet topology characteristics
	are identified as three primary causes of the observed phenomenon.
	We show that this phenomenon yields overlay tree cost savings: Our
	results reveal that the normalized cost L(n)/U(n) is propn 0.9 for
	small n, where L(n) is the total number of hops in all overlay links,
	U(n) is the average number of hops on the source to receiver unicast
	paths, and n is the number of members in the overlay multicast session.
	This can be compared to an IP multicast cost proportional to n 0.6
	to n 0.8},

	in such a way as to saturate the network link of their lowest speed

	to current network infrastructure. As a result of synchronous game
	logic requiring an extreme amount of interactivity, a close look

	It turns out that, often, detecting the cheaters, instead of preventing

	cheats. We present a general framework able to model game time advancements
	in P2P online games. Based on this framework, time cheat detection
	schemes can be easily devised, which monitor the communication patterns
	among peers and do not affect the performances of the game system.
	To provide evidence of our claim, we present in this paper two different

  abstract = {A pervasive requirement of distributed systems is to deal with churn-change
	in the set of participating nodes due to joins, graceful leaves,
	and failures. A high churn rate can increase costs or decrease service
	quality. This paper studies how to reduce churn by selecting which
	subset of a set of available nodes to use.First, we provide a comparison
	of the performance of a range of different node selection strategies
	in five real-world traces. Among our findings is that the simple
	strategy of picking a uniform-random replacement whenever a node
	fails performs surprisingly well. We explain its performance through
	analysis in a stochastic model.Second, we show that a class of strategies,
	which we call "Preference List" strategies, arise commonly as a result
	of optimizing for a metric other than churn, and produce high churn
	relative to more randomized strategies under realistic node failure
	patterns. Using this insight, we demonstrate and explain differences
	in performance for designs that incorporate varying degrees of randomization.
	We give examples from a variety of protocols, including anycast,
	over-lay multicast, and distributed hash tables. In many cases, simply
	adding some randomization can go a long way towards reducing churn.},

  abstract = {Long a matter of folklore, the ” small-world phenomenon ” — the principle
	that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances — was inaugurated
	as an area of experimental study in the social sciences through the
	pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960's. This work was among
	the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to
	speak of the ” six degrees of separation ” between any two people
	in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have
	been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem analytically.
	One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent
	work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence
	that the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks
	arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in
	the evolution of the World Wide Web. But existing models are insufficient
	to explain the striking algorithmic component of Milgram's original
	findings: that individuals using local information are collectively
	very effective at actually constructing short paths between two points
	in a social network. Although recently proposed network models are
	rich in short paths, we prove that no decentralized algorithm, operating
	with local information only, can construct short paths in these networks
	with non-negligible probability. We then define an infinite family
	of network models that naturally generalizes the Watts-Strogatz model,
	and show that for one of these models, there is a decentralized algorithm
	capable of finding short paths with high probability. More generally,
	we provide a strong characterization of this family of network models,
	showing that there is in fact a unique model within the family for
	which decentralized algorithms are effective.},

  abstract = {Application-layer multicast supports group applications without the
	need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here, applications arrange
	themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within
	the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that
	uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An
	advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each
	application to locally derive next-hop routing information without
	requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using
	a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the
	network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal.
	We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol),
	which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present
	measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with
	up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with
	100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly,
	e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over
	30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead
	of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network
	is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast
	transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in
	the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately
	15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with
	1000 nodes.},

	There has been much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network

	tolerance, load balancing and explicit notion of locality. In this

	Our major observation is that the delay proximity is not always a
	good predictor of quality and that other network parameters are to
	be considered as well based on the application requirements. Particulary,
	the best peer to contact is not always the delay closest one. This

  year = {2009},
  month = {April},
  abstract = {Designing an overlay network for publish/subscribe communication in
	a system where nodes may subscribe to many different topics of interest
	is of fundamental importance. For scalability and efficiency, it
	is important to keep the degree of the nodes in the publish/subscribe
	system low. It is only natural then to formalize the following problem:
	Given a collection of nodes and their topic subscriptions connect
	the nodes into a graph which has least possible maximum degree and
	in such a way that for each topic t, the graph induced by the nodes
	interested in t is connected. We present the first polynomial time
	logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem and prove an
	almost tight lower bound on the approximation ratio. Our experimental
	results show that our algorithm drastically improves the maximum
	degree of publish/subscribe overlay systems. We also propose a variation
	of the problem by enforcing that each topic-connected overlay network
	be of constant diameter, while keeping the average degree low. We
	present a heuristic for this problem which guarantees that each topic-connected
	overlay network will be of diameter 2 and which aims at keeping the
	overall average node degree low. Our experimental results validate
	our algorithm showing that our algorithm is able to achieve very
	low diameter without increasing the average degree by much.},

	called Meridian, for performing node selection based on network location.
	The framework consists of an overlay network structured around multi-resolution
	rings, query routing with direct measurements, and gossip protocols
	for dissemination. We show how this framework can be used to address
	three commonly encountered problems, namely, closest node discovery,
	central leader election, and locating nodes that satisfy target latency
	constraints in large-scale distributed systems without having to
	compute absolute coordinates. We show analytically that the framework
	is scalable with logarithmic convergence when Internet latencies
	are modeled as a growth-constrained metric, a low-dimensional Euclidean
	metric, or a metric of low doubling dimension. Large scale simulations,
	based on latency measurements from 6.25 million node-pairs as well
	as an implementation deployed on PlanetLab show that the framework
	is accurate and effective.},

  abstract = {We study a fundamental tradeoff issue in designing a distributed hash
	table (DHT) in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks: the size of the routing
	table versus the network diameter. Observing that existing DHT schemes
	have either 1) a routing table size and network diameter both of
	O(log 2 n), or 2) a routing table of size d and network diameter
	of O(n 1 d/), S. Ratnasamy et al. (2001) asked whether this represents
	the best asymptotic "state-efficiency" tradeoffs. We show that some
	straightforward routing algorithms achieve better asymptotic tradeoffs.
	However, such algorithms all cause severe congestion on certain network
	nodes, which is undesirable in a P2P network. We rigorously define
	the notion of "congestion" and conjecture that the above tradeoffs
	are asymptotically optimal for a congestion-free network. The answer
	to this conjecture is negative in the strict sense. However, it becomes
	positive if the routing algorithm is required to eliminate congestion
	in a "natural" way by being uniform. We also prove that the tradeoffs
	are asymptotically optimal for uniform algorithms. Furthermore, for
	uniform algorithms, we find that the routing table size of O(log
	2 n) is a magic threshold point that separates two different "state-efficiency"
	regions. Our third result is to study the exact (instead of asymptotic)
	optimal tradeoffs for uniform algorithms. We propose a new routing
	algorithm that reduces the routing table size and the network diameter
	of Chord both by 21.4\% without introducing any other protocol overhead,
	based on a novel number-theory technique. Our final result is to
	present Ulysses, a congestion-free nonuniform algorithm that achieves
	a better asymptotic "state-efficiency" tradeoff than existing schemes
	in the probabilistic sense, even under dynamic node joins/leaves.},

	Our architecture is a hybrid scheme focusing on NVEs' interest management.
	Our scheme takes the advantage of both structured overlay, i.e. Distributed
	Hash Table (DHT), and the unstructured P2P architecture. It not only
	has more stable and consistent performance with respect to neighbor
	discovery, but also is more scalable and fault tolerant than the
	existing approaches. Unlike other hexagonal zoning approaches in
	which each participant has a discrete view of the virtual world,
	our zoning design guarantees that all participants have a continuous
	view. Moreover, our novel hierarchical architecture and the message
	dissemination algorithm greatly save network bandwidth and alleviate
	each node's workload. We implemented our infrastructure running on
