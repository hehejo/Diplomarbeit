  title = {Parallelization and performance of interactive multiplayer game servers},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Summary form only given. An important application domain for online
	services is interactive, multiplayer games. An essential component
	far realizing these services is game servers that can support large
	numbers of simultaneous users in a single game world. We use a popular,
	3D, interactive, multiplayer game server, Quake, to study this important
	class of applications. We present the design and implementation of
	a multithreaded version of the server. We examine the challenges
	in scaling this class of applications to large numbers of users,
	mainly task decomposition and synchronization. We present preliminary
	performance results for a server with up to eight processors. We
	find that: (i) scaling interactive, multiplayer games that exhibit
	fine-grain interactions in a detailed 3D world to large numbers of
	players is a challenging task, (ii) the main bottlenecks are lock
	synchronization during request processing and high wait times due
	to fine grain workload imbalances at global synchronization points.
	(iii) Significant future improvements are possible using techniques
	that take advantage of game-specific knowledge.},

  abstract = {As virtual environments have grown in size, increasing attention is
	being brought to the issue of filtering data that is of no interest

	Typically, interest management is thought of as a one step process:
	data flows in from the network, and either is rejected or accepted.
	This paper outlines a three-tiered approach to interest management,
	utilizing dynamic multicast group assignment based on a loadbalanced
	octree design. Initial prototyping suggests that it is possible to
	create virtual environments with the number of entities interacting
	in the environment at least an order of magnitude larger than previously
	demonstrated. 2. INTRODUCTION As virtual environments grow in size
	and grow in number of clients, it has become increasingly important
	to filter unneeded data before it arrives at a client for processing.
	This filtering process is known as interest management. In the past
	there have been several approaches taken. ...},

  abstract = {Distributed multi-player games use dead reckoning vectors to intimate
	other (at a distance) participating players about the movement of
	any entity by a controlling player. The dead reckoning vector contains
	the current position of the entity and the velocity components. When
	a participating player receives a vector, traditionally it puts the
	entity at the current position specified by the vector and starts
	projecting the path of the entity from that point using the local
	clock of the receiver. In this paper we show that this traditional
	method of usage of dead reckoning vector brings in inaccuracy in
	the receivers' rendering of the entity. This inaccuracy can be substantial
	even with low network delay between the sender-receiver pairs and
	increases with network delay. We propose the use of globally synchronized
	clocks among the participating players and a time-stamp augmented
	dead reckoning vector that enables the receiver to render the entity
	accurately. We modified the popular game BZFlag with this technique,
	and compared the accuracy seen in game playing using the traditional
	method and the proposed technique. We conducted several types of
	experiments varying the frequency of generation of dead reckoning
	vectors and the delay between the sender and the receivers. The experiments
	show significant quantitative improvement in accuracy even for 100ms
	delay between the sender-receiver pairs and appreciable qualitative
	improvement in game playing experience.},

  abstract = {In a distributed multi-player game that uses dead-reckoning vectors
	to exchange movement information among players, there is inaccuracy
	in rendering the objects at the receiver due to network delay between
	the sender and the receiver. The object is placed at the receiver
	at the position indicated by the dead-reckoning vector, but by that
	time, the real position could have changed considerably at the sender.
	This inaccuracy would be tolerable if it is consistent among all
	players; that is, at the same physical time, all players see inaccurate
	(with respect to the real position of the object) but the same position
	and trajectory for an object. But due to varying network delays between
	the sender and different receivers, the inaccuracy is different at
	different players as well. This leads to unfairness in game playing.
	In this paper, we first introduce an "error" measure for estimating
	this inaccuracy. Then we develop an algorithm for scheduling the
	sending of dead-reckoning vectors at a sender that strives to make
	this error equal at different receivers over time. This algorithm
	makes the game very fair at the expense of increasing the overall
	mean error of all players. To mitigate this effect, we propose a
	budget based algorithm that provides improved fairness without increasing
	the mean error thereby maintaining the accuracy of game playing.
	We have implemented both the scheduling algorithm and the budget
	based algorithm as part of BZFlag, a popular distributed multi-player
	game. We show through experiments that these algorithms provide fairness
	among players in spite of widely varying network delays. An additional
	property of the proposed algorithms is that they require less number
	of DRs to be exchanged (compared to the current implementation of
	BZflag) to achieve the same level of accuracy in game playing.},

	messages from the clients to one or more game servers. Unlike proxy-based
	architectures that have been proposed in the literature where the
	proxies replicate all of the game state, the communication proxies
	in the proposed architecture support clients that are in proximity
	to it in the physical network and maintain information about selected
	portions of the game space that are relevant only to the clients
	that they support. Using this architecture, we propose an authority
	assignment mechanism that divides the authority for deciding the
	outcome of different actions/events that occur within the game between
	client and servers on a per action/event basis. We show that such
	division of authority leads to a smoother game playing experience

	achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it
	reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention

	state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity
	by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the
	special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are
	latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We
	present user study results using a prototype implementation based

	players performing random actions can approximate measurements of
	games played by real humans, provided that the starting positions

	describe a dynamic version of EASES that does not require the pre-production
	of hash-chain keys to reduce key preparation time and memory usage
	at the expense of a slight delay of message commitment. As shown
	by both analysis and experiments, the computation, memory, and bandwidth

  abstract = {In content networks, messages are routed on the basis of their content
	and the interests (subscriptions) of the message consumers. This
	form of routing offers an interesting alternative to unicast or multicast
	communication in loosely-coupled distributed systems with large number
	of consumers, with diverse interests, wide geographical dispersion,
	and heterogeneous resources (e.g., CPU, bandwidth). In this paper,
	we propose a novel protocol for content-based routing in overlay
	networks. This protocol guarantees perfect routing (i.e., a message
	is received by all, and only those, consumers that have registered
	a matching subscription) and optimizes the usage of the network bandwidth.
	Furthermore, our protocol takes advantage of subscription aggregation
	to dramatically reduce the size of the routing tables, and it fully
	supports dynamic subscription registrations and cancellations without
	impacting the routing accuracy. We have implemented this protocol
	in the application-level routers of an overlay network to build a
	scalable XML-based data dissemination system. Experimental evaluation
	shows that the size of the routing tables remains small, even with
	very large populations of consumers.},

	implementation, where the game state updates are accumulated within
	a fixed time window before transmission. The temporal locality in

  abstract = {MMORPGs have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite
	their success, one of MMORPG's greatest challenges is the increasing
	use of game bots, i.e., auto-playing game clients. The use of game
	bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To
	keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players,
	often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice,
	however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem,
	we analyze the traffic generated by human players vs. game bots and
	propose solutions to automatically identify game bots.Taking Ragnarok
	Online , one of the most popular MMOGs, as our subject, we study
	the traffic generated by mainstream game bots and human players.
	We find that their traffic is distinguishable by: 1) the regularity
	in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude
	of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity
	to network conditions. We propose four strategies and two integrated
	schemes to identify bots. For our data sets, the conservative scheme
	completely avoids making false accusations against bona fide players,
	while the progressive scheme tracks game bots down more aggressively.
	Finally, we show that the proposed methods are generalizable to other
	games and robust against counter-measures from bot developers.},

	Explicit measurements are often unattractive because the cost of

	Vivaldi is a simple, light-weight algorithm that assigns synthetic
	coordinates to hosts such that the distance between the coordinates
	of two hosts accurately predicts the communication latency between
	the hosts. Vivaldi is fully distributed, requiring no fixed network
	infrastructure and no distinguished hosts. It is also efficient:
	a new host can compute good coordinates for itself after collecting
	latency information from only a few other hosts. Because it requires
	little com-munication, Vivaldi can piggy-back on the communication
	patterns of the application using it and scale to a large number
	of hosts. An evaluation of Vivaldi using a simulated network whose
	latencies are based on measurements among 1740 Internet hosts shows
	that a 2-dimensional Euclidean model with height vectors embeds these

	it is essential to efficiently assign the participating clients to
	servers to enhance users' experience in interacting within the DVE.
	This problem is termed the client assignment problem (CAP) in this

	assignment phase and a refined assignment phase to address the CAP.
	Both phases are shown to be NP-hard. Several heuristic assignment

  abstract = {This paper describes the results of the first comprehensive analysis
	of a range of popular on-line, multiplayer, game servers. The results
	show that the traffic behavior of these servers is highly predictable
	and can be attributed to the fact that current game designs target
	the saturation of the narrowest, last-mile link. Specifically, in
	order to maximize the interactivity of the game itself and to provide
	relatively uniform experiences between players playing over different
	network speeds, on-line games typically fix their usage requirements
	in such a way as to saturate the network link of their lowest speed
	players. While the traffic observed is highly predictable, the traces
	also indicate that these on-line games provide significant challenges
	to current network infrastructure. As a result of synchronous game
	logic requiring an extreme amount of interactivity, a close look

	the rules that govern a game, some players will always be tempted
	to break or elude these rules so as to gain an unfair advantage over
	other players. Mitigation schemes are thus needed in online gaming
	platforms. However, it is widely recognized that typical cheating
	prevention schemes introduce complications and overheads in the distributed
	game system, which may seriously jeopardize the online gaming experience.
	It turns out that, often, detecting the cheaters, instead of preventing
	the cheats, could represent a viable solution, especially for time
	cheats. We present a general framework able to model game time advancements
	in P2P online games. Based on this framework, time cheat detection
	schemes can be easily devised, which monitor the communication patterns
	among peers and do not affect the performances of the game system.
	To provide evidence of our claim, we present in this paper two different
	time cheats, namely fast rate cheat and look-ahead cheat, and discuss
	on practicable methods to detect them. Simulation results confirm
	the viability of the proposed approach.},

  title = {Parallel discrete event simulation},
  journal = {Commun. ACM},
  year = {1990},
  volume = {33},
  pages = {30--53},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES), sometimes called distributed
	simulation, refers to the execution of a single discrete event simulation
	program on a parallel computer. PDES has attracted a considerable
	amount of interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint,
	this interest arises from the fact that large simulations in engineering,
	computer science, economics, and military applications, to mention
	a few, consume enormous amounts of time on sequential machines. From
	an academic point of view, parallel simulation is interesting because
	it represents a problem domain that often contains substantial amounts
	of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet paradoxically, is surprisingly
	difficult to parallelize in practice. A sufficiently general solution
	to the PDES problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation
	as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent nature of
	PDES programs has identified it as an application where vectorization
	techniques using supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].
	A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated
	only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation
	model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event.
	For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network
	might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues,
	the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc. Typical events
	might include arrival of a message at some node in the network, forwarding
	a message to another network node, component failures, etc. We are
	especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous systems
	where events are not synchronized by a global clock, but rather,
	occur at irregular time intervals. For these systems, few simulator
	events occur at any single point in simulated time; therefore parallelization
	techniques based on lock-step execution using a global simulation
	clock perform poorly or require assumptions in the timing model that
	may compromise the fidelity of the simulation. Concurrent execution
	of events at different points in simulated time is required, but
	as we shall soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization
	problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem. This article
	deals with the execution of a simulation program on a parallel computer
	by decomposing the simulation application into a set of concurrently
	executing processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by
	mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in simulation
	problems. Comfort and Shepard et al. have proposed using dedicated
	functional units to implement specific sequential simulation functions,
	(e.g., event list manipulation and random number generation [20,
	23, 47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of speedup,
	however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the hierarchical decomposition
	of the simulation model to allow an event consisting of several subevents
	to be processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is to
	execute independent, sequential simulation programs on different
	processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials approach is useful if
	the simulation is largely stochastic and one is performing long simulation
	runs to reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a specific
	simulation problem across a large number of different parameter settings.
	However, one drawback with this approach is that each processor must
	contain sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation. Furthermore,
	this approach is less suitable in a design environment where results
	of one experiment are used to determine the experiment that should
	be performed next because one must wait for a sequential execution
	to be completed before results are obtained.},

  abstract = {Massively multi user virtual environment (MMVE) applications must
	deal with the challenge of update message exchange among a large
	set of nodes distributed over the Internet. Therefore design of scalable
	network protocols is a major concern in such large scale distributed
	architectures. Several approaches have been proposed to aid update
	exchange in MMVEs. Message localization has always been a key point
	in the design of such distributed network protocols. Area of interest
	management (AoIM) mainly deals with the issues related to the update
	message localization with respect to the userpsilas interest. As
	the number of users in the virtual environment increases, update
	message localization becomes more important in order to prevent the
	transmission of a huge bulk of unnecessary updates to uninterested
	users. Therefore, scalable and efficient area of interest management
	is a crucial point in MMVE design. This paper introduces a new zone
	selection and distributed regional message filtering architecture
	for MMVE applications. We propose Delaunay tetrahedrization as a
	good way of virtual world partitioning due to several promising features.
	Moreover we propose the partitioning to be done with respect to barriers
	in order to reach a better performance through the filtering the
	updates that need not be propagated over the barriers. We will also
	introduce a distributed interest management protocol based on the
	previous partitioning technique. Our proposed distributed message
	dissemination approach is capable of providing the interested users
	with variable updates rate according to their required level of detail.},

  abstract = {One of the most serious issues holding back the widespread of 3D contents
	on Internet has been their inaccessibility due to large data volume.
	Many compression and progressive transmission techniques, as well
	as format standards, have been proposed in recent years to make 3D
	streaming increasingly viable for the efficient and accessible delivery
	of 3D contents. However, existing proposals have yet to seriously
	address one of the most important issues in practical adoption -
	a system's scalability in terms of the number of concurrent users.
	We argue that due to 3D contents' large data volume and interactive
	nature, client-server architecture, with its inherently fixed resource
	availability and high cost, will not be suitable to support popular
	Internet-scale 3D streaming. On the other hand, peer-to-peer (P2P)
	architectures hold the promise of both scalability and affordability.
	In this position paper, we describe the potential promises and challenges
	in adapting 3D streaming to P2P networks, using multi-user networked
	virtual environment (NVE) as an example. We also propose Flowing
	LoD (FLoD), a scalable, distributed and fault-tolerant P2P 3D streaming
	mechanism, that is based on Voronoi-based Overlay Network (VON),

	We introduce the concept of zone and zone owner to MOG. Zone is some

	server of a specific zone. According to the demands of the game program,
	each node actively changes its role to zone owner and works in the
	same way as a centralized authoritative server. By dividing the whole
	game world into several zones, workloads of the centralized authoritative
	game server can be distributed to a federation of nodes. We have
	implemented the zoned federation model, and evaluate it with a prototypical
	multi-player game. Evaluation results indicate that our proposed

  abstract = {The increasing availability of broadband Internet access coming along
	with cheap flatrate tariffs changed the way the Internet is used
	over the last years. As a result, we observe more users that become
	producers and collaborate instead of solely consuming information
	as they did before. Besides that, the Internet has become a tool
	for daily use and information dissemination. As push-based information
	services are heavily needed for collaboration and information dissemination,
	it seems like the breakthrough of distributed push publish/subscribe
	on the open Internet is just imminent today, although research has
	been around already for many years now. One reason why most publish/subscribe
	applications are still based on a rather basic centralized mechanism
	and not on a distributed scalable notification service, as it is
	commonly proposed in state-of-the-art publish/subscribe systems in
	research, is the unsolved management issue.This extended research
	abstracts is intended to give an overview of my Ph.D. project on
	self-organizing publish/subscribe, where I want to tackle management
	issues for better applicability. After giving an introduction to
	the pub/sub communication paradigm and motivating the necessity to
	make such systems self-organizing, I will point out the contributions
	of my work. They are centered around making publish/subscribe systems
	self-stabilizing and adaptive by means of self-organizing mechanisms.
	While my work on self-stabilization is nearly finished, introducing
	adaptivity by self-organization is still in an early stage.},

  abstract = {The IGDA Online Games SIG Persistent Worlds White Paper is intended
	to provide a summary of contemporary issues in the development and
	operation of massively multi-player online persistent worlds. We
	have chosen to use the title Persistent State World or PSW to describe
	these online experiences. Also used are the terms: virtual world,
	multi-user domain or multi-user dungeon (MUD), massively multi-player
	(MMP) game, massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) and massively
	multi-player online role-playing game (MMORPG). The sheer variety
	of acronyms and the inadequacy of all of them are indicative of the
	youth of this industry. In particular the authors point out that
	the growth of the persistent worlds market is almost predicated upon
	its moving away from its origins in fantasy role-playing type games.
	Our intention is to provide a broad survey of the market, primarily
	in the US with some examples from overseas, an overview of design
	and production, a guide to technology practices and an introduction
	to the rigors of service and operations. The focus of this paper
	is to provide developers, operators and publishers of persistent
	worlds with information to help them decide whether or not to proceed
	with development; to identify pitfalls along the way; to deliver;
	and then to support these games successfully. The field of PSW development
	and operation is enormously complex and we cannot hope to be exhaustive
	or complete in our overview, but we hope that developers new to the
	field, as well as old hands, will find some useful information within.},

  abstract = {As computer networks increase in size, become more heterogeneous and
	span greater geographic distances, applications must be designed
	to cope with the very large scale, poor reliability, and often, with
	the extreme dynamism of the underlying network. Aggregation is a
	key functional building block for such applications: it refers to
	a set of functions that provide components of a distributed system
	access to global information including network size, average load,
	average uptime, location and description of hotspots, and so on.
	Local access to global information is often very useful, if not indispensable
	for building applications that are robust and adaptive. For example,
	in an industrial control application, some aggregate value reaching
	a threshold may trigger the execution of certain actions; a distributed
	storage system will want to know the total available free space;
	load-balancing protocols may benefit from knowing the target average
	load so as to minimize the load they transfer. We propose a gossip-based
	protocol for computing aggregate values over network components in
	a fully decentralized fashion. The class of aggregate functions we
	can compute is very broad and includes many useful special cases
	such as counting, averages, sums, products, and extremal values.
	The protocol is suitable for extremely large and highly dynamic systems
	due to its proactive structure---all nodes receive the aggregate
	value continuously, thus being able to track any changes in the system.
	The protocol is also extremely lightweight, making it suitable for
	many distributed applications including peer-to-peer and grid computing
	systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our gossip-based
	protocol both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of
	scenarios including node and communication failures.},

	physical environments over the Internet have attained increasing
	importance. Networked virtual environments (NVEs) are typically based

  abstract = {Multi-player Online Games (MOGs) have emerged as popular data intensive
	applications in recent years. Being used by many players simultaneously,
	they require a high degree of fault tolerance, scalability and performance.
	In this paper we analyze how database replication can be used in
	MOGs to achieve these goals. In data replication, clients can read
	data from any database replica while updates have to be executed
	at all available replicas. Thus, reads can be distributed among the
	replicas leading to reduced response time and scalability. Furthermore,
	the system is fault-tolerant as long as a replica is available. However,
	we are not aware of any previous study on the application of database
	replication to MOG. In this paper, we present a system, MiddleSIR,
	which provides database replication support. We illustrate different
	replication protocols implemented in the system along an example,
	explaining how data consistency and fault tolerance can be achieved.
	From there, we design a small multi-player typing game to demonstrate
	how to apply database replication to MOG. We will discuss how different
	replication protocols affect the semantics of the game. Our experiments
	show that database replication can provide good scalability and performance

	activities of thousands of entities interacting in a virtual world
	over a wide area network. Possible applications for DVE systems are
	multiplayer video games, military and industrial trainings, and collaborative
	engineering. In general, a DVE system is composed of many servers
	and each server is responsible to manage multiple clients who want
	to participate in the virtual world. Each server receives updates
	from different clients (such as the current position and orientation
	of each client) and then delivers this information to other clients
	in the virtual world. The server also needs to perform other tasks,
	such as object collision detection and synchronization control. A
	large scale DVE system needs to support many clients and this imposes
	a heavy requirement on networking resources and computational resources.
	Therefore, how to meet the growing requirement of bandwidth and computational
	resources is one of the major challenges in designing a scalable
	and cost-effective DVE system. In this paper, we propose an efficient
	partitioning algorithm that addresses the scalability issue of designing
	a large scale DVE system. The main idea is to dynamically divide
	the virtual world into different partitions and then efficiently
	assign these partitions to different servers. This way, each server
	will process approximately the same amount of workload. Another objective
	of the partitioning algorithm is to reduce the server-to-server communication
	overhead. The theoretical foundation of our dynamic partitioning
	algorithm is based on the linear optimization principle. We also
	illustrate how one can parallelize the proposed partitioning algorithm
	so that it can efficiently partition a very large scale DVE system.
	Lastly, experiments are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness
	of the proposed partitioning algorithm under various settings of
	the virtual world},

	large numbers of simultaneous players, two other popular game classes
	-- first-person shooter (FPS) and real-time strategy (RTS) games

	A main technical problem for scaling these genres to be massively
	multiplayer is the absence of a suitable scalable multiserver networking
	approach. While the commonly used zoning concept performs well for
	an MMORPG, it is barely suitable for RTS and FPS games. As a scalable
	networking alternative for these genres, this article summarizes
	our work on the proxy-server architecture, which uses multiple servers
	for a single game session and implements a full replication of the
	game state at all proxies. We present our work on the game Rokkatan,
	our online evaluator game which enables massively multiplayer real-time
	strategy gaming using our proxy-server network architecture. We discuss
	the implementation of Rokkatan and analyze the distributed computation
	of the proxy-server approach by integrating an analytical scalability

	continuous interactive media, i.e., replicated media which change
	their state in reaction to user initiated operations as well as because
	of the passing of time. Typical examples for this media class are
	networked computer games and distributed VR applications. Existing
	approaches to reach consistency for replicated discrete interactive
	media are briefly outlined and it is shown that these fail in the
	continuous domain. In order to allow a thorough discussion of the
	problem, a formal definition of the term consistency in the continuous
	domain is given. Based on this definition we show that an important
	tradeoff relationship exists between the responsiveness of the medium
	and the appearance of short-term inconsistencies. Until now this
	tradeoff was not taken into consideration for consistency in the
	continuous domain, thereby severely limiting the consistency related
	fidelity for a large number of applications. We show that for those
	applications the fidelity can be significantly raised by voluntarily
	decreasing the responsiveness of the medium. This concept is called
	local lag. It enables the distribution of continuous interactive
	media that are more vulnerable to short-term inconsistencies than,
	e.g., battlefield simulations. We prove that the concept of local
	lag is valid by describing how local lag was successfully used to
	ensure consistency in a 3D telecooperation application.},

	This delay leads to inconsistency and other problems. Dead reckoning
	is often used to reduce the effects of network induced delays and

	and, hence, the consistency of the distributed game, depends on the
	difference between the real and the predicted position of some objects.
	In this paper we discuss prediction methods for games and study their

  abstract = {Multiplayer games, i.e., games where several persons interact simultaneously
	over networks like the Internet, receive much interest. One of the
	reasons is that competing with human counterparts is typically considered
	as much more interesting and challenging than playing just against
	a computer.A major problem of network-based multiplayer games is
	caused by the network transmission delay. This means that it takes
	a while until information, e.g., about the movement of the opponents
	objects and their new position, reaches the receivers. This delay
	causes several difficulties and leads to paradoxical situations.
	For example, consider a racing game with two players, shortly after
	the start both believe that they have the lead because it takes a
	while until the position of the counter player reaches the local
	player. Approaches to provide for a global consistent state of the
	game by introducing a local presentation delay have been proposed,
	however, these increase the application-level delay even more.Therefore,
	it is important to investigate the impact such delays can have on
	the performance of multiplayer games and the attractiveness of these
	games for the human players. Such a study is the purpose of this
	work. We concentrate on real-time games for the Internet where significant
	delays can occur. The evaluation is performed through measurements

  abstract = {Newly emerging game--based application systems such as Second Life
	1 provide 3D virtual environments where multiple users interact with
	each other in real--time. They are filled with autonomous, mutable
	virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. To
	make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they
	are usually built on a client--server based grid subspace division
	where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub--worlds.
	In each sub--world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry
	updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders
	them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from
	a local storage medium. In such systems, the determination of the
	set of objects that are visible from a user's viewpoint is one of
	the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability.
	Specifically, performing real--time visibility tests in extremely
	dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions
	of objects and sub-millions of active users are moving and interacting.
	We recognize that the described challenges are closely related to
	a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry
	objects in the virtual space to a set of multi-dimensional objects
	in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial
	object and a moving query. Unfortunately, existing spatial indexing
	methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments.The main
	goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure
	that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable
	real--time visibility determination. We then uncover many useful
	properties of this structure and compare the index structure with
	various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system
	throughput, and resource utilization. We expect our approach to lay
	the groundwork for next--generation virtual frameworks that may merge
	into existing web--based services in the near future.},

	research have been done in military simulations, virtual reality

	solutions diverge from the problems posed by MCGs. With this in mind,
	this paper provides a concise overview of four aspects affecting
	networking in MCGs. Firstly, networking resources (bandwidth, latency,
	and computational power) set the technical boundaries within which
	the MCG must operate. Secondly, distribution concepts encompass communication
	architectures (peer-to-peer, client/server, server-network), and
	both data and control architectures (centralized, distributed, replicated).
	Thirdly, scalability allows the MCG to adapt to the resource changes
	by parametrization. Finally, security aims at fighting back against
	cheating and vandalism, which are common in online gaming. Keywords---Computer

  journal = {J. ACM},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {51},
  pages = {800--849},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {The traditional assumption about memory is that a read returns the
	value written by the most recent write. However, in a shared memory
	multiprocessor several processes independently and simultaneously
	submit reads and writes resulting in a partial order of memory operations.
	In this partial order, the definition of most recent write may be
	ambiguous. Memory consistency models have been developed to specify
	what values may be returned by a read given that memory operations
	may only be partially ordered. Before this work, consistency models
	were defined independently. Each model followed a set of rules which
	was separate from the rules of every other model. In our work, we
	have defined a set of four consistency properties. Any subset of
	the four properties yields a set of rules which constitute a consistency
	model. Every consistency model previously described in the literature
	can be defined based on our four properties. Therefore, we present
	these properties as a unfied theory of shared memory consistency.Our
	unified theory provides several benefits. First, we claim that these
	four properties capture the underlying structure of memory consistency.
	That is, the goal of memory consistency is to ensure certain declarative
	properties which can be intuitively understood by a programmer, and
	hence allow him or her to write a correct program. Our unified theory
	provides a uniform, formal definition of all previously described
	consistency models, and in addition some combinations of properties
	produce new models that have not yet been described. We believe these
	new models will prove to be useful because they are based on declarative
	properties which programmers desire to be enforced. Finally, we introduce
	the idea of selecting a consistency model as an on-line activity.
	Before our work, a shared memory program would run start to finish
	under a single consistency model. Our unified theory allows the consistency
	model to change as the program runs while maintaining a consistent
	definition of what values may be returned by each read.},

	the game state and logic to un-trusted peer machines, rather than
	using trusted centralised servers. Cheating is a major concern for
	online games, as a minority of cheaters can potentially ruin the
	game for all players. In this paper we present a review and classification
	of known cheats, and provide real-world examples where possible.
	Further, we discuss counter measures used by C/S architectures to
	prevent cheating. Finally, we discuss several P2P architectures designed
	to prevent cheating, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract = {The Mirrored Server (MS) architecture uses multiple mirrored servers
	across multiple locations to alleviate the bandwidth bottleneck in
	the Client/Server (C/S) architecture. Each mirror receives and multicasts
	player updates to the others, simulates the game, and disseminates
	the new game state to players. However, keeping the game state consistent
	between mirrors in the presence of network delay, and maintaining
	game responsiveness requires each server in MS to simulate the game
	multiple times for each game update, and additional times in the
	event of costly rollbacks. In this paper we propose the Enhanced
	Mirrored Server (EMS) architecture. Like in the Peer-to-Peer architecture,
	EMS allows peers to exchange updates directly, resulting in a higher
	tolerance to delay at the mirrors. We propose using bucket synchronization
	in the mirrors so that each server in EMS simulates the game only
	once for each update and does not require rollbacks. The server dissenates
	updates to clients only in the event of inconsistency, and thus its
	outgoing bandwidth is lower than in MS. Our EMS uses cryptographic
	techniques to provide security equivalent to C/S, and prevents the
	timestamp cheat possible in MS. Our analytical analysis and simulations

	it in a relational database. The main challenge of this approach
	is to track the large volume of modifications applied to the world
	in real time. This paper compares a variety of strategies to persist
	changes of the game world. While critical events must be written
	synchronously to the persistent storage, a set of approximation strategies
	are discussed and compared that are suitable for events with low
	consistency requirements, such as player movements. An analysis to
	better understand the possible limitations and bottlenecks of these
	strategies is presented using experimental data from an MMOG research
	framework. Our analysis shows that a distance-based solution offers
	the scalability and efficiency required for large-scale games as
	well as offering error bounds and eliminating unnecessary updates
	associated with localized movement.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement in wireless communications and mobile computing
	devices has opened a wide door for developing interesting mobile
	peer-to-peer multiplayer games (MMGs). In this paper we study an
	important problem of game state update in MMGs. Based on the network
	coding theory, we design the shift coding algorithm. Shift coding
	is running on a finely regulated ring overlay and lets each node
	exchange coded state information with its two immediate neighbors.
	After a few rounds of exchange, every node is guaranteed to receive
	the state information of all the other game members. The results
	of experimental results have shown that shift coding can significantly
	reduce network traffic under various network configurations.},

  title = {On the Semantics of Complex Events in Active Database Management
	Systems},
  journal = {Data Engineering, International Conference on},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {0},
  pages = {392+},
  abstract = {Active database management systems have been developed for applications
	needing an automatic reaction in response to certain events. Events
	can be simple in nature or complex. Complex events rely on simpler
	ones and are usually specified with the help of operators of an event
	algebra. There are quite a few papers dealing with extensions of
	existing event algebras. However, a systematic and comprehensive
	analysis of the semantics of complex events is still lacking. As
	a consequence most proposals suffer from different kinds of peculiarities.
	Independent aspects are not treated independently leading to shady
	mixtures of aspects in operators. Moreover, aspects are not always
	treated uniformly. Operators may have other semantics than expected.
	Operators of different algebras which, at first glance, look the
	same may have different semantics.This paper addresses these problems
	by an extensive and in-depth analysis of the foundations of complex
	events. As a result of this analysis, a (formal) meta-model for event
	algebras will be introduced that subdivides the semantics of complex
	events into elementary, independent dimensions. Each of these dimensions
	will be discussed in detail. The resulting language specification
	fulfils the criteria for a good language design (like orthogonality,
	symmetry, homogeneity, lean set of language constructs) to a large
	extend.},
